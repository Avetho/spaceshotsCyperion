 v0.6.5 - third ship type - heavy fighter - slower than medium more powerful - 500H, 25D
 v0.7 - added ai ships - turn to face you and fire away for 5 seconds, then turn and run around you and away from you for 5 seconds; uses timers, when too close they turn and run to get space, run from mines when in blast radius - 100H, 10D
 v0.7.5 - added special abilities for different ships - light fighter has active camo that is disrupted by laser fire and repairs your ship by 50H, medium fighter has camo disruptor (can see camoed ships, add 5D), heavy fighter has auto turret that can see camo ships, also deal 5D per hit
 v0.8 - added capital ships, they are boss fight and have 8 auto orbital weapon platforms, 2 capital light fighters, and have huge health - 2500H cs, 200H owp 20D, 250H clf 15D, no regen

 v0.9 - added console, can disable damage to you so you can be hacker. Also added a new ship - capital drone - it lays up to 4 small drones that fire rapid weak lasers at the target, each with a ten second life span and ten second recharge when one is destroyed/despawns, also can fire a laser beam that can destroy a light fighter in two hits, has long recharge time, but the ship can only move up down left or right. (nostalgia, anyone? no?) - 300H, 80D beam
 v0.9.5 - added framework for multiple ship systems damage - weapons, armor, movement, added a critical hit point at the cockpit where it is 1 hit ka-boom!
